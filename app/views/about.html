  <h1>About Me && This Site</h1>
  <i>April 23rd, 2016</i>
  <p>I'm Collin Barnwell - I'm a <a target="_blank" href="github.com/collinbarnwell">coder</a>, a writer (kind of) and a Northwestern student (for a few more weeks).
    I'm interested in business, tech, artificial intelligence, film and journalism, among other things.
  </p><p>
    I try to have at least one programming project and at least one non-programming creative project going at all times, and this is the place where I plan to put up the things that I make.
