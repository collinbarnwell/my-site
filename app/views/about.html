  <p>I'm Collin Barnwell - I'm a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/collinbarnwell">coder</a>, a reader, a writer, and a proud American <img src="/images/us_flag.png">.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in business, tech, artificial intelligence, film, traveling and journalism, among other things.
    I try to have at least one programming project and at least one non-programming creative project going most of the time.
